## DressUp
This repo contains my code for the Facebook AI Hackathon for the winter of 2020. My 
project is called 'DressUp'.

**What is DressUp?**

DressUp is a computer vision project meant to solve the problem that almost all of us have,
 not knowing what to wear for the day. This app is meant to be used to 
appropriately give suggestions what to wear for the day based on the weather outside and 
what clothes of yours match together. The user will take pictures of all of their clothes and based on 
the weather, the app will tailor specific outfits from your clothes so you're both prepared 
and looking fresh!

**How it works**

The app starts by the user sending in pictures of their clothing articles. The program
will then store these pictures in a collection in which the user can always continue to add or 
remove clothes from. The user can then hit a button and the app will generate an outfit 
for the day. The app will take into consideration what the weather is like and different 
styles and fashions. If you don't like the options given you can hit a refresh button and 
it'll generate new options.
